## CodeBook for tidy_data.txt

This file describes the variables from the tidy_data.txt file, which is related to the Coursera project "Getting and Cleaning Data".
The file tidy_data.txt contains the averages of 79 feature measurements. These measurements concern 6 activities for 30 individuals.
They are available in floating-point format, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by t) are resulting from the capture of accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals. Frequency-domain signals (variables prefixed by f), resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.
